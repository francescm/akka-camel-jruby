akka-camel-jruby (and spring)

Just get messages from a ActiveMQ queue and log them.

Runs form command line: sh run.sh.
Requires a lot of jars, please check the run.sh file. Please create your own credential.properties file as:
 activemq.username=system
 activemq.password=manager
with your ActiveMQ credentials.

Works with akka-1.3.1 and camel-2.7.5.
